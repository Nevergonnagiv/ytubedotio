So this is an app where you can install YouTube videos (MP3, MP4, WEBM format). It took me 7 days to make it and ngl it really paid off. Before i continue, please dont use the GitHub Pages. Just, please. Anyways, 90% of the code was made by me, 5% legally taken from my friend and other 5% are from the internet (i. e. ChatGPT, Google...).
